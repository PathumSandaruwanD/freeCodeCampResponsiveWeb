        <h3>Time Line of Albert Einstein's Life</h3>
        
        <li><strong>1879</strong> - Albert was born in Ulm, Germany. The family moved to Munich when Albert was one year old.</li>
        <li><strong>1884</strong> - When Albert was five he was given a compass by his father. He was fascinated by it and how it worked</li>
        <li><strong>1889</strong> - Max introduced Albert to math and science. Albert was ten years old.</li>
        <li><strong>1894</strong> - Albert finished his schooling in Munich with medical training. He moved to Milan with his family.</li>
        <li><strong>1895</strong> - Albert moved to Switzerland at 16 years old to attend Aarau Cantonal School.</li>
        <li><strong>1896</strong> - Albert graduates at the top of his class. He was a year younger than the other students.</li>
        <li><strong>1901</strong> - Albert slacked off in further schooling, even after doing so well. Because of this he had a hard time finding a good job.</li>
        <li><strong>1902</strong> - Albert Einstein got a job in the patent office. He used his understanding of math and science in his new position, and it made him happy.</li>
        <li><strong>1905</strong> - Einstein submitted his first paper on his theory of thermodynamics. It was the first of many.</li>
        <li><strong>1909</strong> - After working at the patent office and writing his theories, Einstein got a job teaching theoretical physics at the University of Zurich.</li>
        <li><strong>1911</strong> - He was given an invitation to the first-ever world physics conference. He was the youngest physicist there.</li>
        <li><strong>1913</strong> - He believed science's understanding of gravity was wrong, and he worked on a new theory which he would later test with a solar eclipse.</li>
        <li><strong>1919</strong> - After publishing his Theory of Relativity and correctly predicting the effects of a solar eclipse, Einstein's name went around the world.</li>
        <li><strong>1922</strong> - Einstein was awarded his first Nobel Prize. He was on his way to Japan when he got the news.</li>
        <li><strong>1933</strong> - He visited America for the first time because he feared the rising Nazi party in Germany.</li>
        <li><strong>1945</strong> - World War II ended and Einstein continued his research. He made advances in heat, gravity, and relativity, and he published over 300 scientific reports.</li>
        <li><strong>1955</strong> - Albert Einstein died in April of heart failure.</li>
